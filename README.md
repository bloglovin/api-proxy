api-proxy
=========

API proxy written in Go

## Build & Run

Install Go `brew install go` / `sudo apt-get install golang`.

Make sure that you have a $GOPATH set up, otherwise, create a folder `mkdir $HOME/go` and add `export GOPATH=$HOME/go` and `export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH` to your `.profile` or whatever your shell sources to get going.

Then install the api-proxy: `go get github.com/bloglovin/api-proxy` and run it like so: `api-proxy`.
